# Useful Contacts and Links
During your time teaching at SU, there are some useful contacts and links that you will make use of over and over. To help you get into your work, review the information below.

Almost all official SU resources will use your SU email and/or username and password to access them. Sometimes you only use the username, and sometimes you will use the whole email address.

## Contacts

* Trish Henley (henleyt@seattleu.edu) Associate Dean, NCS
* Suki Kwon (kwonsu@seattleu.edu) Student Success Specialist for NCS

## Links
* [SU Online](https://suonline.seattleu.edu/) - Access to grading, pay information, and many other useful screens. (Login with your username, not your full email address.)
