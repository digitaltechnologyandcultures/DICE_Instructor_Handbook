# The Weekly Cycle

Each course is organized as ten (10) Modules. Each Module addresses a specific topic in the course, and the Modules build on each other. Just as the structure of the course follows a distinct pattern, the weekly process of running the course also follows a pattern.

In order to maintain forward momentum, and to develop a keen sense of community, it is helpful to be proactive and communicative so students are kept aware that they are part of a group moving through this material together. You can help students keep up and keep in touch by reaching out regularly so that communication becomes a familiar practice and expectation rather than an exception.

## Monday
On Mondays you will perform the following course maintenance tasks:

* Rotate the "Current Week" section on the homepage
    * Move the previous week's welcome video down into the list of Modules so 
        students can revisit your welcome video if they choose.
    * Copy the current Module's link and description into the highlighted "Current Week" area.
* Record an introductory video for the week and post it in the "Current Week" area of the course homepage.
    * These videos should be 5 minutes or less.
    * Offer encouraging words based on the previous week's work. Be sure to mention any leftover items from the previous week.
    * Describe the content of the upcoming week, highlighting required readings, the assignment and the discussion for this week.
    * Mention any other details, such as upcoming university deadlines, Meetups, or due dates for larger projects in the course.
    * Be upbeat and encouraging, but also acknowledge when content may be difficult.
    * Be human! Let students get to know you through these weekly introductions. Show your enthusiasm for the material and the work they are doing.
* Begin grading. 
    * Grades should be completed by Wednesday at the latest.

## Tuesday through Saturday
The rest of the week has fewer structured deliverables that must be met.
