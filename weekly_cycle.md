# The Weekly Cycle

Each course is organized as ten (10) Modules. Each Module addresses a specific topic in the course, and the Modules build on each other. Just as the structure of the course follows a distinct pattern, the weekly process of running the course also follows a pattern.

In order to maintain forward momentum, and to develop a keen sense of community, it is helpful to be proactive and communicative so students are kept aware that they are part of a group moving through this material together. You can help students keep up and keep in touch by reaching out regularly so that communication becomes a familiar practice and expectation rather than an exception.

## Weekly Videos
Every week you will have a brief overview video that walks students through that week's assignments, frames readings, et cetera. 

* Record an introductory video for the week and post it to the appropriate week's "overview page" (e.g., "Week 2"). 
    * These videos should be approximately 5 minutes. (A tutorial for one approach to making these videos is available on the SU Webdev Youtube channel. [Click here to watch it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xehP91_bZU))
    * Offer encouraging words based on the previous week's work. Be sure to mention any leftover items from the previous week.
    * Describe the content of the upcoming week, highlighting required readings, the assignment and the discussion for this week.
    * Mention any other details, such as upcoming university deadlines, Meetups, or due dates for larger projects in the course.
    * Be upbeat and encouraging, but also acknowledge when content may be difficult.
    * Be human! Let students get to know you through these weekly introductions. Show your enthusiasm for the material and the work they are doing.

## Grading
Both in completely online and hybrid formats, which lean heavily on the feedback process to enrichen, bolster, and support the learning process, reliable, consistent, and effortful feedback and adminstration is required. 

* Students, ideally, should never have to wait longer than three days to get their grades/feedback. 
* Instructors are required to log their grades in the course website "gradebook." No exceptions. 
* Students' graded work should be turned in via the course website assignments window. No exceptions. 
* Whenever possible, students should be turning in their work in "durable" formats. (Example: A .png file of an infographic is the durable media format, whereas a link to the infographic somewhere on the web is not. A .py file is a durable format of a Python script. A .docx is a durable format of a blog entry. The idea is to be able to "go back" and retrieve that media in the future.) 
* All grading should employ a rubric, which breaks out the grading criteria for a given assignment into component parts and makes clear to students the weights and values for those different components. No exceptions. 

## Office Hours and Student Communication 
Instructors are required to hold one office hour a week, per course. These hours should be scheduled just before, or just after, your normal scheduled course time. For online courses, there are less structured office hours (meaning they occur on a per-meeting basis, scheduled with individual students). For both cases, instructors are asked to be available to students via Slack, Canvas, and Email.

* Responses to student inquiries, ideally, will not take longer than a few hours, during normal business hours.
* Instructors are required to be on campus for office hours associated with a hybrid format course. 

## Roster Checks
Sometime near the start of the quarter you will recieve an email notification that your "Roster Check" is due. Roster checks are a means by which to compare attendance in your class (Canvas activity in the case of online courses) against your roster. If a student has not logged into the Canvas course, or has not come to the first face-to-face session, you should follow up with an email to that student. If they indicate that they are dropping the course, or you recieve no response, you should represent this in your roster check. [This can save a forgettful student thousands of dollars at the end of the term when they realize that they never formally dropped the course.] 

## Starfish
All programs in the School of New and Continuing Studies make use of Starfish a student success tracking system. Periodically throughout the quarter you will receive an email reminder to navigate to MySU and to complete a Starfish report. In these reports you can give students "Kudos" for good work, or raise "flags" for missing/late work, et cetera.

Keep in mind that when you report issues through Starfish, the student receives a notification as well as NCS and DICE staff (including the DICE Program Director and the Student Success Specialist). Any and all messaging here should be directed to the student in a warm and encouraging manner.
