# Grading

Grading is a crucial part of teaching a course. Students must understand how well they achieved the learning outcomes for each assignment, and the grade is one of the primary methods for an instructor to convey that information to a student.

Each graded assignment in the course is not the same, and should not be treated the same. Grades are calculated across the board for you, so for the most part you need only to determine the grades for each assignment and the rest of the work will be handled by Canvas. Even so, it's useful to keep a few things in mind as you grade.

## Grading Projects
As a rule, grades should be derived from the rubric attached to projects. Rubrics criteria have titles and descriptions -- be sure to review rubrics, outcomes, and what those outcomes mean by reviewing the assignments in your course as well as the Learning Outcomes page in your course. On the Learning Outcomes page, you can browse the groups of outcomes and gain a deeper understanding of how all of them work together.

When grading rubrics, keep in mind the five point scale of meeting outcome expectations:

1. Does not meet expectations; outcome not achieved.
2. Nearly meets expectations, but with significant issues or reservation in achieving the outcome.
3. Meets expectations, with only minor issues or reservation in achieving the outcome.
4. Meets expectations, demonstrating understanding and capability achieving the outcome.
5. Exceeds expectations, demonstrating understanding, capability, and pushing usage of skills and knowledge further than required to achieve the outcome.

In addition to the Learning Outcomes, on each rubric you will usually have an opportunity to evaluate how well the student has "fulfilled the assignment scenario". Project assignments are often based on imaginary production situations, and students are sometimes asked to think from a particular context (as if they are a specific member of a specific team). In all cases, this is your opportunity to evaluate how well you feel they took up the assignment, and it allows you to provide additional feedback about how well they have done.

## Grading Discussions
For discussion assignments, grades are generally given on a "complete/incomplete" measure: If students give satisfactory responses and participation in the discussion, then they receive full credit. In some courses, you may assign point values to discussions, and you can use that to encourage more full participation in the discussion.

Each discussion in every course asks students to post a very specific response. For the most part, grades should be based on how well they fulfill the requirements outlined in the discussion. Some discussion prompts specify that responding to other students is a requirement. In those cases, grades should take into account whether that specified minimum engagement has been met. However, in other cases it's up to you to evaluate whether students are participating fully and grade accordingly. 

As long as you keep in mind that the goal of the discussion assignments is actually to discuss concepts and broaden our understanding of the things we are studying, you may use grading to help you achieve that goal.

## Timeliness in Grading
It's important to grade in a timely manner. Students rely on grades to gauge their progress in the course, so they require that constant feedback. The cadence of handing in work and giving feedback is crucial to a good class experience.

You should also consider the way your grading rhythm affects students. Especially when students are struggling, it can be very damaging to fall behind in grading and then send a student a string of low graded assignments. Students will always react better to finding out about bad grades sooner rather than later. And giving students more time to react to low grades makes it much easier to work with them to improve those grades.

## Revisions and Late Assignments
For the most part, we aim to have a system that is tolerant enough of the regular fluctuations of adult life to allow for some flexibility on late assignments. Given the technical nature of our courses, it's not unusual for somebody to have very good intentions, but to get stuck over a weekend before a deadline on a very small matter that they can quickly clear up with a brief chat with the instructor on Monday. In these cases, and other reasonable cases, you are encouraged to be as generous as possible when considering late work. 

Although we want to teach our students to be timely and responsible, we also do not want to create artificial penalties for late work, especially when there is a reasonable explanation for the tardiness. However, we also do not want our students to fall behind. Our courses are only 10 weeks long, and students who fall behind can quickly find themselves under water.
