# Philosophy and Approach

The WATS program is designed to help students learn technology skills in an accelerated, craft-based manner. This means that we do not necessarily follow all of the same patterns and paths of a traditional technology education. We are educating students to assume roles in the industry, developing software applications. We value the following:

* Practical experience and skills that can be put to use building things.
* Thoughtful reflection on those skills and experiences so that students understand the deeper ramifications and meaning of their education.
* Clear communication of both praise and instruction throughout the learning process.
