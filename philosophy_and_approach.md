# Philosophy and Approach

The DICE program is designed to cultivate analytical thinking and artful practice within the realm of emerging media. As such, pedagogically, the program emphasizes a "flipped" model, wherein students are given content via the web, and then asked to apply content in an apprentice model that emphasizes coaching, guidance, and constant feedback. The program values: 

* Thoughtful, engaging, content that inspires people to generate (and answer) their own questions. 
* Timely, useful feedback which helps get people from "here" to "there." 
* Presence, both in the sense of availability to students who might have questions as well as the the sense of bringing one's personality into the classroom.
* Modeling of academic excellence and rigor, both in oral and written communication. 
* Artistic creativity and inventiveness, which demonstrates command of emerging media. 

Our course and program design is strongly influenced by the key principles of the [Ignatian Pedagogical Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignatian_Pedagogical_Paradigm):

* Context
* Experience
* Reflection
* Action
* Evaluation
