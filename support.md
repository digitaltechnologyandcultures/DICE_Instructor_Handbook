# Support for Instructors
As instructors in WATS, you enjoy the support of the SU School of New and Continuing Studies staff and systems. In turn, those services and individuals can direct you to an even larger community of support around the SU campus. Take a moment to learn about some of the useful support services and professionals who can help you with your teaching work.

## Student Support
One of the primary reasons to reach out to the broader WATS, NCS, and SU communities is to get help for a student. As an instructor, you are in the position to observe any issues a student is encountering and to help them seek assistance. 

Any questions you have about student support can be directed to Suki Kwon, the NCS Student Success Specialist. You may email her at [kwonsu@seattleu.edu](mailto:kwonsu@seattleu.edu). Suki is a longtime student support professional who can both provide you guidance if you have questions about talking or working with a student, and who can work directly with the student to guide them to support services all around campus. 

In addition to our professional staff, SU faculty is able to use the Starfish system to help track student success issues.
