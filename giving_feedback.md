# Giving Feedback

Providing timely, accurate, and detailed feedback is critical when responding to student work. Each week students will produce work that involves writing and creating media. This work deserves high quality feedback. 

There are several ways we can provide feedback to students with the tools at our disposal. We should leverage all these mechanisms to make sure our students have the best feedback possible.

## Timing Feedback

It's essential for students to receive feedback as soon as possible. If they have asked a question, or have trouble on an assignment, you should respond to them sooner, rather than later. Normally, it's possible to send a quick reply such as, "Tricky problem! Let me think and I'll get back to you shortly," so the student knows they can expect a reply. 

Students often become discouraged when they send a question or ask for help and they receive silence in response.

## Feedback Within Canvas

Within Canvas you should give feedback using the Rubrics and the Assignment Comments feature. 

For all written work, "line-by-line" feedback should be tracked in MS Word "track changes" or some other simliar feedback mechanism that helps students think about spelling, grammar, word choice, organization, et cetera. 

Your feedback should make reference to, and be pointed at, the rubric attached to that particular assignment. 

Students should be able to use your feedback to improve there work and demonstrate their learning from your guidance. Many assignments involve a "rough draft" phase; where good feedback is present, there will be a noticable difference between the first try, and the finished product. The difference, in this case, is likely the instructor's feedback. 

When giving feedback, keep in mind that this is an opportunity to inspire people, to help them discover (and cultivate) their talents and knowledge. If students recieve a grade, it should be accompnaied by an explanation why. And, that explanation should be framed productively toward the ends of student growth, enrichment, improvement. 

To this end, the "easy A" is innapropriate for our students. If it's easy, the liklihood that learning is occuring is low. We want our students to learn, and to learn a lot. But we also want them to find passion in their learning. DICE instructors are masters of blancing academic rigor, personalized feedback, and constructive feedback to do just that.
