# Giving Feedback

Providing timely, accurate, and detailed feedback is critical when responding to student work. Each week students will produce work that involves writing code and creating media. This work deserves high quality feedback. 

There are several ways we can provide feedback to students with the tools at our disposal. We should leverage all these mechanisms to make sure our students have the best feedback possible.
