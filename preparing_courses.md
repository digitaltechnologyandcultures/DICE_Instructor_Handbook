# Preparing Courses

When you get into your course for the first time, you will see an empty course shell. Canvas will encourage you to get building your course quickly. For WATS courses, we teach from common syllabi, so every course is a copy of the master version of the course. In order to prepare your course for students, you will need to copy the master version of the course into your new course, then you'll need to complete an audit checklist.

It's very important to be conscientious about looking for issues in the course before you publish it for student access. Although you can always fix issues that are noticed later (and you're expected to fix issues and notify the program director whenever they come up; see below), it's best to avoid issues in the first place. Encountering broken content or bad information in a course can ruin the experience for our students.

**Please Note**: The Course Prep process should happen **1-2 weeks before the quarter starts**. If there are issues completing any of the preparation steps, please contact the WATS Program Director.

## Step One: Copy the Course
To copy the master course into your course, complete the following steps:

First, Go to the Settings page in the course

Then, Click the link in the upper right that says "Import Course Content"

You will be presented with a drop-down menu. Select "Copy a Canvas Course" and search for courses with "MASTER" in their title:

Select the Master copy of the course you are teaching and then select "All Content". Also be sure to select the "Adjust events and due dates" checkbox.

## Step Two: Invite the Support Team
For some courses it may be beneficial to have observers or helpers who can assist you with different tasks. Be sure to invite these people using the `+ People` button on the People page of the course.

If this is the first course you're teaching for WATS, you must invite the WATS Program Director into your course as a Teacher.

## Step Three: Pre-Course Checklist
Complete the following checklist every time you copy a course into a new instance.

## Step Three: Welcome Video & Message
Once you have the course prepped, you should create a welcome video for Week 0 just like you would for every other week. Post it at the top of the Home page like you normally would. In this video, you should discuss the significant parts of the Week 0: About This Course module. This module is crucial because it is basically the syllabus for the course.

As well as posting a video, you should send students a welcome message through Canvas letting them know that the course is open and ready for them.

This step is really the same as your normal weekly video and email. The Canvas message is crucial because it's the only way you can get a link to your specific course in front of your students. This helps them find the online course and engage more effectively.
